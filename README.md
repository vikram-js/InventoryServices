# InventoryServices
dotnet core WEB API

This is a dotnet core InventoryServices WebApi that performs the following functions:
1) Add items to inventory
2) Retrieve the list of items in inventory

It also has a JSON Web Token based Authentication.
Works best with InventoryApp dotnet core Console Application which is also present on my github.
